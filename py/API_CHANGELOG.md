# API Changelog to Python-only code (from numenta/nupic repo)

Note: that these changes only affect python-only code under `py/` path 
(= `from nupic.xxx import yyy`), and do not affect our C++ python bindings 
(= `from nupic.bindings.xxx import yyy`)

- `Serialization` not supported as canproto was removed.
