# htm.core

[![CI Build Status](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core/actions)

This is a Community Fork of the [nupic.core](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core) C++ repository, with Python bindings.

## Project Goals

- Actively developed C++ core library (Numenta's NuPIC repos are in maintenance mode only)
- Clean, lean, optimized, and modern codebase
- Stable and well tested code
- Open and easier involvement of new ideas across HTM community (it's fun to contribute, we make master run stable, but are more open to experiments and larger revamps of the code if it proves useful).
- Interfaces to other programming languages, currently C++ and Python

## Features

 * Implemented in C++11 through C++17
    + Static and shared lib files for use with C++ applications.
 * Interfaces to Python 3 and Python 2.7 (Only Python 3 under Windows)
 * Cross Platform Support for Windows, Linux, OSX and ARM64
 * Easy installation.  Many fewer dependencies than nupic.core, all are handled by CMake
 * Significant speed optimizations
 * Simplified codebase
    + Removed CapnProto serialization.  It was pervasive and complicated the
code considerably. It was replaced  with simple binary streaming serialization
in C++ library.
    + Removed sparse matrix libraries, use the optimized Connections class instead
 * New and Improved Algorithms
    + Revamped all algorithms APIs, making it easier for developers & researchers to use our codebase
    + Sparse Distributed Representation class, integration, and tools for working with them
 * API-compatibility with Numenta's code.
   An objective is to stay close to the [Nupic API Docs](http://nupic.docs.numenta.org/stable/api/index.html).
   This is a priority for the `NetworkAPI`.
   The algorithms APIs on the other hand have deviated from their original API (but their logic is the same as Numenta's).
   If you are porting your code to this codebase, please review the [API Changelog](API_CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

### Binary releases

If you want to use `htm.core` from Python, the easiest method is to install from [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/htm.core/)
  - Note: to install from `pip` you'll need Python 3.7+ 

```
python -m pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ htm.core
```
Note: to run all examples with visualizations, install including extra requirements:
`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ htm.core[examples]`

If you intend to use `htm.core` as a library that provides you Python \& C++ HTM, 
you can use our [binary releases](https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core/releases).

#### Prerequisites

For running C++ apps/examples/tests from binary release: none. 
If you want to use python, then obviously:

- [Python](https://python.org/downloads/)
    - Version 3.4+ (Recommended)
    - Version 2.7
      + We recommend the latest version of 2.7 where possible, but the system version should be fine.
      + Python 2 is Not Supported on Windows, use Python 3 instead.
      + Python 2 is not tested by our CI anomore. It may still work but we don't test it. We expect to drop support for Python2 around 2020.

  Be sure that your Python executable is in the Path environment variable.
  The Python that is in your default path is the one that will determine which
  version of Python the extension library will be built for.
  - NOTE: People have reported success with `Anaconda` python.
  - Other implementations of Python may not work.
  - Only the standard python from python.org have been tested.


### Building from Source

Fork or download the HTM-Community htm.core repository from https://github.com/htm-community/htm.core

#### Prerequisites

- same as for Binary releases, plus:
- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)  Version 3.7  (3.14 for MSVC 2019)
    - You should use `cmake` provided by your distribution,
    - if not available, you can install it from Python: `python -m pip install cmake>=3.10`
- **C++ compiler**: c++11/17 compatible (ie. g++, clang++)

Be sure you are running the right version of python. Check it with the following command:
```
python --version
```

#### Simple Python build (any platform)

1) At a command prompt, go to the root directory of this repository.

2) Run: `python setup.py install --user --force`

   This will build and install everything.

   * If you run into problems due to caching of arguments in CMake, delete the
   folder `Repository/build` and try again.  This is only an issue when
   developing C++ code.

3) After that completes you are ready to import the library:
```python
python.exe
>>> import htm           # Python Library
>>> import htm.bindings  # C++ Extensions
>>> help( htm )          # Documentation
```

#### Simple C++ build 

After downloading the repository, do the following:
```
cd path-to-repository
mkdir -p build/scripts
cd build/scripts
cmake ../..
make -j install
```

| Build Artifact | File Location |
| :------------- | :------------ |
| Static Library         | `build/Release/lib/libhtm-core.a`    |
| Shared Library         | `build/Release/lib/libhtm-core.so`   |
| Header Files           | `build/Release/include/`             |
| Unit Tests             | `build/Release/bin/unit_tests`       |
| Hotgym Dataset Example | `build/Release/bin/benchmark_hotgym` |
| MNIST Dataset Example  | `build/Release/bin/mnist_sp`         |

 * A debug library can be created by adding `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to the cmake command above.
   + The debug library will be put in `build/Debug`.
     Use the cmake option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../Release` to correct this.

 * The -j option can be used with the `make install` command to compile with multiple threads.

 * This will not build the Python interface.


### Docker Builds

#### Build for Docker amd64 (x86_64)

Our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) allows easy (cross) compilation from/to many HW platforms. 

If you are on `amd64` (`x86_64`) and would like to build a Docker image:

```sh
docker build --build-arg arch=amd64 .
```

#### Docker build for ARM64

If you are on `ARM64` and would like to build a Docker image, run the command
below. The CI automated ARM64 build (detailed below) uses this
specifically.

```sh
docker build --build-arg arch=arm64 .
```

> Note: When building on platforms that use MUSL stdlibc++ instead of GLIBC, such as Alpine linux in our Docker container, 
you need to pass `-DNTA_LIBC_MUSL=1` to the `cmake` command. In the `Dockerfile` this is done automatically. 


### Automated Builds, CI

We use Github `Actions` to build and run multiplatform (OSX, Windows, Linux, ARM64) tests and releases.

 * [Config](./.github/workflows/arm64-build.yml)


## Workflow: Using IDE

### Generate the IDE solution  (Netbeans, XCode, Eclipse, KDevelop, etc)

 * Choose the IDE that interest you (remember that IDE choice is limited to your OS).
 * Open CMake executable in the IDE.
 * Specify the source folder (`$HTM_CORE`) which is the location of the root CMakeList.exe.
 * Specify the build system folder (`$HTM_CORE/build/scripts`), i.e. where IDE solution will be created.
 * Click `Generate`.

#### For MS Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 as the IDE

After downloading the repository, do the following:
 * NOTE: Visual Studio 2019 requires CMake version 3.14 or higher.
 * CD to the top of repository.
 * Double click on `startupMSVC.bat`
    - This will setup the build, create the solution file (build/scripts/htm.cpp.sln), and start MS Visual Studio.
 * Select `Release` or `Debug` as the Solution Configuration. Solution Platform must remain at x64.
 * Build everything.  This will build the C++ library.
 * In the solution explorer window, right Click on 'unit_tests' and select `Set as StartUp Project` so debugger will run unit tests.
 * If you also want the Python extension library; then delete the `build` folder and then in a command prompt, cd to root of repository and run `python setup.py install --user --force`.

#### For Visual Studio Code as the IDE
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can be used on any of our three platforms (Windows, Linux, OSx). 
You will need the C/C++ Tools extension by Microsoft and CMake Tools by vector-of-bool.

Startup Visual Studio Code and open the folder containing your htm.core repository which will set the workspace. Let it scan for a kit.  Clear all of the notifications (lower right) so it can let you do the scan.

Then set your project level settings by initializing  <repository>/.vscode/settings.json to the following as a starting point.

For Windows 10:
```
  .vscode\settings.json          
    {
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceRoot}/build/scripts",
    "cmake.generator": "Visual Studio 16 2019",
    "cmake.platform": "x64",
    }
```
To use Visual Studio 2017 as the tool chain, change generator to "Visual Studio 15 2017" and set the platform to "win32".  Note that the ninja generator, the default, did not work very well on Windows.

For Ubuntu and OSx:
```
   .vscode/settings.json
    {
    "cmake.buildDirectory": "${workspaceRoot}/build/scripts",
    "cmake.generator": "gcc",
    }
```


#### For Eclipse as the IDE
 * File - new C/C++Project - Empty or Existing CMake Project
 * Location: (`$HTM_CORE`) - Finish
 * Project properties - C/C++ Build - build command set "make -C build/scripts VERBOSE=1 install -j 6"
 * There can be issue with indexer and boost library, which can cause OS memory to overflow -> add exclude filter to
   your project properties - Resource Filters - Exclude all folders that matches boost, recursively
 * (Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers, 2019-03)

For all new work, tab settings are at 2 characters, replace tabs with spaces.
The clang-format is LLVM style.

### Workflow: Debugging 

Creating a debug build of the `htm.core` library and unit tests is the same as building any C++ 
application in Debug mode in any IDE as long as you do not include the python bindings. i.e. do 
not include `-DBINDING_BUILD=Python3` in the CMake command.
```
(on Linux)
   rm -r build
   mkdir -p build/scripts
   cd build/scripts
   CMake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
```

However, if you need to debug the python bindings using an IDE debugger it becomes a little more difficult. 
The problem is that it requires a debug version of the python library, `python37_d.lib`.  It is possible to
obtain one and link with it, but a way to better isolate the python extension is to build a special `main( )`
as [explained in debugging Python](https://pythonextensionpatterns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging/debug_in_ide.html).

Be aware that the CMake maintains a cache of build-time arguments and it will ignore some arguments passed
to CMake if is already in the cache.  So, between runs you need to clear the cache or even better,
entirely remove the `build/` folder (ie. `git clean -xdf`).

### Workflow: Dependency management

The installation scripts will automatically download and build the dependencies it needs.

 * [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)   (Not needed by C++17 compilers that support the filesystem module)
 * [LibYaml](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) or [Yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
 * [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
 * [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
 * [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
 * [cereal](https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/)
 * [mnist test data](https://github.com/wichtounet/mnist)
 * [digestpp](https://github.com/kerukuro/digestpp) (for SimHash encoders)
 * and [python requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

Once these third party components have been downloaded and built they will not be
re-visited again on subsequent builds.  So to refresh the third party components
or rebuild them, delete the folder `build/ThirdParty` and then re-build.

If you are installing on an air-gap computer (one without Internet) then you can
manually download the dependencies.  On another computer, download the
distribution packages as listed and rename them as indicated. Copy these to
`${REPOSITORY_DIR}/build/ThirdParty/share` on the target machine.

## Testing

### There are two sets of Unit Tests:

 * C++ Unit tests -- to run: `./build/Release/bin/unit_tests`
 * Python Unit tests -- to run: `python setup.py test` (runs also the C++ tests above)
   - `py/tests/`
   - `bindings/py/tests/`

## Examples

### Python Examples

There are a number of python examples, which are runnable from the command line.
They are located in the module `htm.examples`.

Example Command Line Invocation: `$ python -m htm.examples.sp.hello_sp`

Look in: 
- `py/htm/examples/`
- `py/htm/advanced/examples/`

### Hot Gym

This is a simple example application that calls the SpatialPooler and
TemporalMemory algorithms directly.  This attempts to predict the electrical
power consumption for a gymnasium over the course of several months.

To run python version:
```
python -m htm.examples.hotgym
```

To run C++ version: (assuming current directory is top of repository)
```
./build/Release/bin/benchmark_hotgym
```

There is also a dynamically linked version of Hot Gym (not available on MSVC). 
You will need specify the location of the shared library with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

To run: (assuming current directory is top of repository)
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/Release/lib ./build/Release/bin/dynamic_hotgym
```

### MNIST benchmark

The task is to recognize images of hand written numbers 0-9.
This is often used as a benchmark.  This should score at least 95%.

To run: (assuming current directory is top of repository)
```
  ./build/Release/bin/mnist_sp
```

In Python: 
```
python py/htm/examples/mnist.py
```
