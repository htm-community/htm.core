R"(The SDR Classifier takes the form of a single layer classification network.
It accepts SDRs as input and outputs a predicted distribution of categories.

Categories are labeled using unsigned integers.  Other data types must be
enumerated or transformed into postitive integers.  There are as many output
units as the maximum category label.

Example Usage:
    # Make a random SDR and associate it with a category.
    inputData  = SDR( 1000 ).randomize( 0.02 )
    categories = { 'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 3 }
    clsr = Classifier()
    clsr.learn( inputData, categories['B'] )
    numpy.argmax( clsr.infer( inputData ) )  ->  categories['B']

    # Estimate a scalar value.  The Classifier only accepts categories, so
    # put real valued inputs into bins (AKA buckets) by subtracting the
    # minimum value and dividing by a resolution.
    scalar     = 567.8
    minimum    = 500
    resolution = 10
    clsr.learn( inputData, int((scalar - minimum) / resolution) )
    numpy.argmax( clsr.infer( inputData ) ) * resolution + minimum  ->  560

During inference, the output is calculated by first doing a weighted
summation of all the inputs, and then perform a softmax nonlinear function to
get the predicted distribution of category labels.

During learning, the connection weights between input units and output units
are adjusted to maximize the likelihood of the model.
